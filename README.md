This Python project demonstrates how to convert spoken words from an audio file into text using the SpeechRecognition library and Google's free Web Speech API. The script processes .wav files and outputs a text transcription, making it a powerful starting point for applications like:

Voice assistants

Voice-to-text editors

Podcast analysis

Subtitle generation

Audio indexing

ðŸ“Œ Project Description
In today's digital world, voice-based interaction is becoming increasingly important. Whether it's for accessibility, automation, content analysis, or archiving purposes, transcribing speech into text unlocks a wide range of applications.

This project provides a simple, open-source implementation for developers and researchers looking to incorporate automatic speech recognition (ASR) capabilities into their Python applications using only standard tools and free services.

This project uses the popular Python package SpeechRecognition, which provides a high-level interface to several speech recognition engines, including the Google Web Speech API â€” a cloud-based ASR engine known for its ease of use and high accuracy.

ðŸ”§ How It Works
Loads a .wav audio file using the sr.AudioFile() method.

Processes the audio using recognizer.record() to extract the speech data.

Transcribes the audio to text via recognizer.recognize_google() using Googleâ€™s Web Speech API.

Returns the transcribed text or an error message if transcription fails.

âœ… Use Cases
Voice-controlled bots or assistants

Audio note-taking systems

Voice-based data entry

Automatic captioning tools

Accessibility tools for the hearing impaired

Content moderation or spoken media analysis
